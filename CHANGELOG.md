## 0.2.0 - 2026-10-08

The first published release of Poros, a dual-pane SFTP and rsync client for Linux and Windows.

- **Tabs and docking**: local folders and server sessions are tabs. Drag a tab onto another
  pane to merge it in or split the pane, resize with the dividers, or pull a tab out into a
  window of its own.
- **Transfer queue** with parallel workers, each on its own SSH connection. Large files are
  split across idle connections, and the worker count can change while transfers run.
- **Folder synchronization** one way or both ways, by size and time, size alone or contents,
  with rsync-style excludes and a preview of every upload, download, deletion and conflict
  before anything changes.
- **rsync delta transfers** over Poros's own SSH connection, so only the changed parts of a file
  cross the network and nothing needs installing locally, Windows included. Servers without
  rsync get the whole file over SFTP.
- **Saved connections**. Passwords and passphrases are kept only when you ask, and then only in
  the system keychain.
- **Every common key format**: OpenSSH, PEM, PKCS#8 and PuTTY `.ppk` versions 2 and 3, plus
  SSH agents and Pageant, password and keyboard-interactive login.
- **Host key checks** against your existing `known_hosts`, which Poros never writes to.
- **Themes** as shareable JSON files, ten built in, with a color picker for every part of the
  interface, and settings for fonts, text size, corner roundness and row height.
- **Windows setup** that upgrades an older Poros in place, keeping settings and saved
  connections.
